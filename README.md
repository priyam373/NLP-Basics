# NLP-Basics
## This .ipynb file contains the implementation of some of the basic NLP concepts such as Tokenization, Text cleaning, Stopwords, Stemming, Lemmatization and feature extraction technique including Bag of words. below is a brief description about what each of these concepts entail:
## Tokenization: This is used to break down corpus into documents or words.
## Stopwords: this is used to eliminate irrelavant words such as He, She, Him, Their etc.
## Stemming: it is to reduce words to their base/root word but this may produce some meaningless words due to its mechanism of removing suffixes.
## Lemmatization: this is same as stemming but it converts words into their base word that are meaningful.
The use of stemming and lematization depends on the use case whether exact root word needs to be preserved or not.
## Bag of Words(BOW): this is used to convert words into vectors/features
